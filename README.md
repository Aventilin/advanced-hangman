# advanced-hangman
A vanilla javascript frontend and python CGI backend implementation of the famous game "hangman", with some extra rules.

It is easy to set up a local web server with Python that supports CGI.
This can help if you want to test your CGI scripts locally. To do this, run the command python -m http.server --cgi from the command line. This will start a web server in the current directory that you can surf to at localhost:8000. Make sure you use Python 3. On Windows you will have to use Windows Subsystem for Linux for this. In Ubuntu you will then have to run python3 -m http.server --cgi.
